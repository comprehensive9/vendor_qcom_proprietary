     * physical control of the device and has not compromised the secure environment. For instance,
     * proof of user identity may be considered proof of presence if it meets the requirements
     * above. However, proof of identity established in one security domain (e.g. TEE) does not
     * constitute proof of presence in another security domain (e.g. StrongBox), and no mechanism
     * analogous to the authentication token is defined for communicating proof of presence across
     * security domains.
     *
     * Some examples:
     *
     *     A hardware button hardwired to a PIN on a StrongBox device in such a way that nothing
     *     other than a button press can trigger the signal constitutes proof of physical presence
     *     for StrongBox keys.
     *
     *     Fingerprint authentication provides proof of presence (and identity) for TEE keys if the
     *     TEE has exclusive control of the fingerprint scanner and performs fingerprint matching.
     *
     *     Password authentication does not provide proof of presence to either TEE or StrongBox,
     *     even if TEE or StrongBox does the password matching, because password input is handled by
     *     the non-secure world, which means an attacker who has compromised Android can spoof
     *     password authentication.
     *
     * Finally, note that no mechanism is defined for delivering proof of presence to Keymaster,
     * except perhaps as implied by an auth token. This means that Keymaster must be able to check
     * proof of presence some other way. Further, the proof of presence must be performed between
     * begin() and the first call to update() or finish(). If the first update() or the finish()
     * call is made without proof of presence, the keymaster method must return
     * ErrorCode:PROOF_OF_PRESENCE_REQUIRED and abort the operation. The caller must delay the
     * update() or finish() call until proof of presence has been provided, which means the caller
     * must also have some mechanism for verifying that the proof has been provided.
